What follows is basically some sappy New Years Resolution-type bullshit.
Actually, don't read it.

New beginnings
--------------

And so here we are again. Last I checked, my Mango12 page was still up. 
But alas, that was a very impractical solution for myself. I had a page 
at Mango12, so what? What was I going to do with that? I had no projects
that were particularly interesting, nor did I have a blog system. And
I think that in today's world, blogs are necessary for a software
developer. It gets you known. It keeps you in touch. And so that's what
I've decided to do now.

What's next?
------------

So what *is* next? Well, I have a specific project I'd like to focus on, and
that is reverse engineering of the Zune MTPZ protocol. I've been running into
some difficulties, although I can't say that's unexpected from a project that
involves disassembling native applications.
