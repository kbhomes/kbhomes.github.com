Yes, I finally have a website of sorts. Maybe now I can get my name out there.

New beginnings
--------------

So now I have a blog. And in this blog, I *plan* to talk about ongoing projects,
document research, and just write down my musings. But I'm not a blogger; I'm a 
programmer (by hobby, for now). What I'm truly afraid of is making a blog post
here and there, and then ignoring it for months. I feel that it's necessary
to make posts at least somewhat frequently, and so I'll try to do that enough
to make it a habit. We'll see what happens.

What's next?
------------

So what *is* next? Well, I have a [specific project](/projects.html)
I'd like to focus on, and that is reverse engineering of the Zune MTPZ protocol. 
I've been running into some difficulties, although I can't say that's unexpected 
from a project that involves disassembling native applications. Hopefully I'm
successful with this.
