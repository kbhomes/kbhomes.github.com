<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>Seems like you're interested in some of my projects or research; that's cool. Or perhaps you're interested in harvesting my email address;
I'd prefer you didn't but I guess I haven't much say in the matter.</p>

<p>Below are a few ways you can contact me.</p>

<ul class="contacts">
	<li><a href="https://github.com/kbhomes/">Github repositories</a> - you'll find all of my public projects that have code attached to them
	<li>Email - sajidanwar94 [at] gmail.com</li>
</ul>
