<p>Just some stuff that I've done. Are they worth looking at? I don't know. <span class="secret">When did I become so apathetic?</span></p>

		<h2 class="project_title">Zune MTPZ Handshake <span class="project_subtitle">[ongoing research]</span></h2>
		<p class="project_description">The Zune family of devices performs a proprietary handshake with authorized Zune 
		software in order to unlock the device for syncing. Therefore, on a platform where Zune software does not exist
		(e.g.: Linux), one cannot sync with the device nor modify it.</p>

		<p>The aim of this project is to reconstruct that handshake, adding it onto the open source libmtp project such that
		media players can benefit from this. The approach I am taking currently is to disassemble the Objective-C application
		Windows Phone 7 Connector for the Mac (which implements this MTPZ handshake).</p>

		<p class="project_description">TextCaptchaBreaker was a quick project, written in Python, to demonstrate the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the 
		<a href="http://textcaptcha.com">textCaptcha service</a> as a viable alternative to the current standard of visual CAPTCHAs.</p>
